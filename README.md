Emotion recognition is a significant subject in fields like psychology and cognitive sciences, as well as in applications employing machine learning methods to develop intelligent models capable 
of understanding human behavior. In this paper, a classic problem of identifying negative emotions in images is addressed. The problem is tackled through supervised machine learning techniques, 
utilizing the Visual Geometry Group (VGG) neural networks. 
Within the paper, the performance of two models, VGG16 and VGG19, is analyzed using the Extended Cohn-Kanade (CK+) dataset.
